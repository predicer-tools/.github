Managing energy devices and participation in energy markets is a complex task. The open-source Predicer tools help to optimize and control devices and assets that have exposure to energy/electricity markets and have some level of controllability.

## Predicer

Predicer is an optimization engine for maximising profits (professional users) or minimising costs (household level users) based on stochastic multi-stage optimization. It can consider uncertainty in all input parameters (e.g. power prices or ambient temperature) and finds out the optimal choice using Conditional Value at Risk approach for the given set of input data.

## Hertta

Hertta is an user interface for Predicer using Home Assistant. It can connect with devices supported by Home Assistant.
